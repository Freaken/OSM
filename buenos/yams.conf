## Network interface for networking exercises
## 
## Note that you have to change mac-address (every instance
## you run must have different mac-address): replace XXXX with
## any hexadecimal digits.
##
## Note also that you must change the UDP port number XXXXX to
## something sensible. This number must be same on all _your_
## virtual machines. Tip: Use Unix id(1) command and use your
## uid as UDP port number (UDP ports must be over 1024 below
## 65536, however).
##
## Note also that the IP in the example below is _multicast_ address.
## It is probably valid in most installations (at least inside the LAN).
